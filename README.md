# IowaHomes - Predic(t)ament

# Program installation

The first program you will need is R:
[R download](https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/)
After R you need will need an IDE to use R in, I recommend R studio:
[R studio download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
You will also need MySQL for the database:
[MySQL download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
Also needed is MySQL workbench:
[My SQL workbecnh download](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)

## Package installation - R

Inside your IDE you will need to install the following packages in order for your application to work:
install.packages('kknn')
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("RMySQL")
install.packages("dbConnect")


## How to use

After installing all the required programs and packages you can load the IowaHomes project file into Rstudio and with the dump file you can set up your MySQL database with appropriate data.
